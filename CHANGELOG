# Changelog

    supplied with bad inputs.

- 0.2.1 (2025-02-24)
  * Merely swaps out the base16 library used for the Wycheproof tests
    (in favour of ppad-base16).

- 0.2.0 (2025-01-10)
  * API change, opting for "derive" in place of "hkdf" to work more
    smoothly with a import qualifier like "KDF".

  * Initial release, supporting a generic RFC5869 HKDF function.
